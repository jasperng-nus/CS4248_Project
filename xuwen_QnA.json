},
{
  "question": "What is the mechanism of action of stellate ganglion blocks in treating lymphedema?",
  "answer": "Stellate ganglion blocks (SGBs) are thought to improve lymphedema by interrupting sympathetic nervous system activity, which can reduce vasoconstriction and improve blood flow. This may enhance lymphatic drainage, reduce inflammation, and improve microcirculation in affected tissues, potentially leading to reduced swelling and improved lymphatic function."
},
{

},
{
  "question": "How does high-dose estrogen treatment for tall stature affect bone density?",

},
{
  "question": "What are the most effective components of online mindfulness interventions?",

},
{
  "question": "How does thiamine deficiency contribute to impaired oxygen consumption in critically ill patients?",
  "answer": "Thiamine deficiency impairs oxygen consumption in critically ill patients because thiamine is essential for pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, which converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA for entry into the Krebs cycle. Deficiency leads to anaerobic metabolism despite adequate oxygen delivery, causing lactic acidosis and cellular energy failure. This 'cytopathic hypoxia' reduces mitochondrial oxygen utilization efficiency."
},
{
  "question": "What is the recommended daily intake of thiamine for critically ill patients?",
  "answer": "The recommended daily intake of thiamine for critically ill patients typically ranges from 100-300 mg/day, which is significantly higher than the 1.2 mg/day recommended for healthy adults. For patients with suspected deficiency or in specific conditions like septic shock or alcoholism, doses of 200-500 mg intravenously may be administered."
},
{

},
{
  "question": "How does reduced mobility affect cognitive function in elderly populations?",
  "answer": "Reduced mobility in elderly populations can negatively affect cognitive function through multiple mechanisms: decreased cerebral blood flow, reduced social engagement leading to cognitive understimulation, increased depression risk, disrupted sleep patterns, reduced physical activity that would normally promote neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, and potentially increased inflammation that affects brain health."
},
{
